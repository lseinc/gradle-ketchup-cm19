### OBJECTIVE
Gradle is yet another build tool that leverages other frameworks like Ant and Maven. It expands the lifecycles and allows extensions. Join this session as we see how Ketchup was added to the the receipt (ok, Kotlin is a Polish Ketchup) to extend the script by adding things like static type checking and a cleaner Domain Specific Language (DSL). The attendee will leave knowing the latest features of Gradle, how it can improve building in a CI/CD environment, and how Kotlin can improve on the lifecycle by providing easy customizations.
